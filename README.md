# Star Schema to Strategic Insight: SQL & Python for Healthcare Cost Analysis

## üìÑ Project Summary

This project demonstrates a complete **end-to-end data analytics lifecycle** for a complex healthcare dataset. The primary goal was to transform raw operational data into **actionable business intelligence** for improving **cost management** and **patient satisfaction**.

The solution showcases the crucial integration of **Data Modeling (Star Schema)**, **Advanced SQL**, and **Statistical Analysis** in **Python** to validate hypotheses, identify key cost drivers, and deliver **strategic recommendations**.

The process involved:
* **Data Understanding** and profiling in Python (Pandas).
* Designing and implementing a **Star Schema** in MySQL.
* Performing **rigorous Data Cleaning** and **Transformation** using advanced SQL techniques.
* Integrating SQL and Python for **Statistical Analysis** and validation.
* Drawing **Strategic Insights** and preparing final reports.

## üìÇ Data Source

The dataset consists of eight related operational tables covering patient visits, costs, and providers. The data is used strictly for educational and portfolio purposes. **Note:** Due to the sensitivity of healthcare data and licensing, the raw data files are **not shared** in this repository.
